# HTML_To_Audio

Writes the paragraph text of local HTML files to MP3 audio files using Google Translate

I couldn't find any audio book versions of Theodore Rex, but I did have an HTML version of the book via some [prior work](https://github.com/treatmesubj/Erenow-Book-DL), so I figured I'd just do some sort of text-to-speech so that I could listen to my books on walks.
